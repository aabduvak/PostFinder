# PostFinder Bot

**PostFinder Bot** helps streamline your content management by searching for specific posts based on keywords. Here's how it works:

1. **Search:** Enter keywords, and the bot will find relevant posts.
2. **Forward to Admin:** The bot sends these posts to the admin for review.
3. **Approval:** If the admin approves, the bot automatically posts the content to the admin's channel.

Simplify your workflow and ensure quality content with PostFinder Bot!
